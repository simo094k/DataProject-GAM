## Load dataset

```{r}
filepath <- "../Datasets/thoracotomy_waveforms/pt18.RDS"
full_dataload <- readRDS(filepath, refhook = NULL)
```

```{r}
add_time <- function(data, ms_between_obs = 8, time_origin = "2021-09-03") {
  #' adds a column containing time with increments of ms_between_obs
  #' data:             a dataframe like structure
  #' ms_between_obs:   the amount of milliseconds between each cycle
  df <- tibble(data)
  df$time_ms <- seq(0, nrow(df)*ms_between_obs-ms_between_obs, ms_between_obs)

  return(df)

create_patient <- function(filepath) {
  #' creates a dataframe containing cvp and time in ms and s for open chest
  #' filepath:        the path of the patient file
  dataload <- readRDS(filepath, refhook = NULL)
  patient <- data.frame(open_chest_cvp = dataload$open_chest$CVP) # extract cvp numbers from data
  patient <- add_time(patient)
  return(patient)
}
```

```{r}
pt18 <- create_patient(filepath)
qrs_ms <- full_dataload$open_chest$QRSmarker_ms

# The following code is to give an index to each measurement for which position it has in its heartbeat 
# cycle. Also removes rows containing NAs giving only rows where we know start and end of cycle
pt18 <- na.omit(gen_annotation_index(pt18, qrs_ms, 'time_ms', 'qrs')) 
pt18 <- na.omit(gen_annotation_index(pt18, seq(0, nrow(pt3)*8, 5000), 'time_ms', 'insp'))

### Test for unit root (Augmented Dickey Fuller)

We use the augmented Dickey Fuller test to check the order of integration (AR_). If it is above zero, we are dealing with a time series which isn't weakly dependent nor stationary.

```{r}
adf.test(pt18$open_chest_cvp)
```

We cannot reject AR41. This points towards heavy autocorrelation in our time series. To visually support this claim we plot the autocorrelations:

```{r}
acf(pt18$open_chest_cvp)
```

Again heavy autocorrelation. At lags up to 45 we have autocorrelation. This is expected of our time series, because CVP is usually a stable value that varies inside a fine interval ([8,12]). If the CVP is increasing at one observation, it is expected to increase at the next observation as well. Therefore, the heavy autocorrelation is expected.

Inspect data to find stable period of measurements:

```{r inspecting cvp over time}
dygraph(data = pt18[,c("time_s","open_chest_cvp")])
```

Stable period (130 - 190): 

```{r slicing data}
pt18_sliced <- pt18[pt18$time_s > 200 & pt18$time_s < 300,]
```

We try to add a rho-term to our bam-modelling to account for this autocorrelation. We expect this to reduce the complexity and the wiggliness of our smooth effects - on the other hand we could lose some confidence in our estimates.

```{r}
cvp_gam <- bam(
        open_chest_cvp ~ s(qrs_rel_index, bs = 'cc', k = 50) +
            s(insp_rel_index, bs = 'cc', k = 30) +
            ti(
                qrs_rel_index,
                insp_rel_index,
                bs = c('cc', 'cc'),
                k = c(20, 10)
            ) +
            s(time_s),
        method = 'REML',
        data = pt18_sliced,
        rho = 0.9,
        nthreads = 16 # Number of (virtual) cores
    )
```

Visualize:

```{r visualising gam object, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 7, out.width="100%"}
gratia::draw(cvp_gam)
```

### Testing for heteroskedasticity:

Now we will test for heteroscedasticity. This means that the variance of our cvp measurements changes depending on our explanatory variables.

```{r}
model <- lm(data=pt18, formula=closed_chest_cvp ~ time_ms+ insp_rel_index*qrs_rel_index)
#summary(model)
car::ncvTest(model)
```

We find that our p-value is very low meaning that the possibility of heteroscedasticity is very low. We therefore don't find the need to account for heteroscedasticity in our gam.
